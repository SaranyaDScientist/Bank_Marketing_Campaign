# BANK MARKETING CAMPAIGN

# Problem Statement:

There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions
to take. After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing
as frequently as before.
Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so
banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better
chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to
further increase their revenues.
The Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a
term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients.
Find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we have to analyze the last marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find conclusions in order to develop future strategies.
